            I can tell you how to break, but it's up to you to actually do it.The lock uses keywords that are scattered across four locations in Paris. You'll have to go to each one and find the keyword. The order of the locations doesn't matter, just as long as you go to every location. Do you understand? That's the only way you will be able to retrieve the painting. 
            Here, I'll give you a guide to help you find them. 
            \n\n
            I'll text you when I can to help you out, but you have to leave now. There are agents all around from your agency collecting pieces of information that you need. You'll have to figure out a way to piece them together on your own. `
